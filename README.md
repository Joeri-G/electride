# Electride
Electride is a simple template that allows you to quickly create and build apps that run on the electron platform while also using the power and flexibility of React

Currently `npm start` is only supported on Linux and MacOS, Windows users will have to maually run `npm react-start` and `npm electron-start` in two separate terminal windows.

When the process is in development mode it will show the React dev server in the electron window but after the package has been built it is completely standalone.
